# orb

orb offers a few simple methods for several common problems of orbital mechanics, like transformations between various coordinate systems and simple orbit propagation using Keplerian elements.

## API

### orb.constants
[#](src/constants/common.js) orb.constants.common

[#](src/constants/time.js) orb.constants.time

[#](src/constants/earth.js) orb.constants.earth

[#](src/constants/earth.js) orb.constants.wgs84

[#](src/constants/earth.js) orb.constants.grs80

### orb.common
[#](src/common/angular.js) orb.common.**deg2rad**(deg) Converts degree to radian

[#](src/common/angular.js) orb.common.**rad2deg**(rad) Converts radian to degree

### orb.time
*todo*

### orb.transformations
*todo*

### orb.position
*todo*

### orb.vector
Common vector and matrix operations, these are only included to make dependencies unnessesary. 
Donâ€™t use these, there are a lot of better, more comprehensive and well tested libraries to do this.
